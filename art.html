                                <p>Journey of a neuronal cargo. Cargo receives a judgment on whether it can be transported to axon vs dendrite. Once it enters its right compartment, say axon, it faces roadblocks in the form of crowding in the narrow geometries of a neuron. After passing through all those road blocks, the cargo now reaches a point where it has to choose between entering one process vs the other. After all this tedious decision making, cargo finally reaches its destination.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Our lab is interested in linking cell biology of the neuron to function and behaviour of the organism. We focus on how transport of axonal cargo is regulated, using C. elegans as a model organism. Using a combination of classical genetics, molecular and biochemical approaches, along with in vivo imaging techniques, our lab investigates synaptic vesicle protein trafficking, regulation of cargo-motor complex, axoplasmic crowding and regulation of cargo distribution (viz. synaptic vesicles and mitochondria) along the neuronal process.</p>
